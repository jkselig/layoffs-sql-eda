Key Takeaways

1. Layoffs Peaked in Late 2022 and Early 2023
- Monthly layoffs spiked significantly during late 2022.

2. Top Companies by Layoffs
- A small number of companies were responsible for disproportionately large layoff events.
- Several firms showed **100% layoff rates**, indicating they went out of buinsess.

3. Country-Level Trends
- The majority of layoffs occurred in the United States, followed by India and Canada.  Important to remember this is reported layoffs.
- However, some smaller countries had much higher **average layoff percentages**, showing localized volatility.

4. Industries Hit Hardest
- Consumer, Retail and Finance industries had the highest total layoffs.
- The Transportation and Crypto sectors had the highest average percentage laid off, indicating deeper cuts per company.

5. Layoffs and Funding
- Surprisingly, companies that raised over $500M accounted for a large portion of layoffs.
- There was no clear inverse relationship between high funding and layoff prevention.

6. Startup Stage Impact
- Later-stage companies (Series C+, IPO) saw larger layoff events, likely due to unsustainable growth or missed profitability targets.
- Early-stage startups saw fewer but sometimes complete (100%) cuts.

7. Normalized Metrics Tell a Different Story
- Some smaller companies laid off far more per $1M raised, pointing to inefficient capital use or market misalignment.
- Average percentage laid off helped highlight struggling firms that didn’t necessarily have massive headcount numbers.

Conclusion

This EDA helped expose not only the companies most affected by layoffs, but also the broader structural and funding-related trends driving these decisions. By combining raw totals with normalized and percentage-based analysis, I was able to uncover deeper patterns across time, geography, and business context.

Further exploration with visualizations and predictive modeling could expand this analysis into forecasting or risk modeling for startup sustainability.
