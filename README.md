# 📉 Layoffs SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores global tech layoffs using SQL. The goal is to uncover trends by company, industry, country, and time — and to evaluate how funding levels and startup stage relate to layoffs.

## 📂 Data Source & Preparation

The dataset was sourced from [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) and cleaned in a separate repository:  
👉 [Layoffs Data Cleaning Repository](https://github.com/jkselig/layoffs-data-cleaning)

After cleaning, the data was imported into a SQL table named `layoffs_staging2` for analysis.
